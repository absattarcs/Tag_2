      <h2>Choose your trip</h2>
      <p>
        We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of
        comfort and quality, and a solid value to our guests. These inns offer a
        superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, traditional cuisine,
        and authentic charm. They are typically small, independently-owned
        properties which reflect the character and hospitality of the
        surrounding alpine community. We know the owners personally, have a
        longstanding relationship with them, and we find they bend over
        backwards to provide our guests with an exceptional experience.
